# SFS-MAKE-MID
This script speeds conversion of an SBC/screen/battery/cellular device into MID.

Device specific configuration such as kernels should still should be checked manually.

This needs the latest versions of KDE 4 specific scripts/config files.

The kde applications script is the latest one for the project for kde 4.

The adduser script was needed because I disliked how adduser worked.
