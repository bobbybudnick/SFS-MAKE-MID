edit: Archiving this as any more MID related scripts will go into the main MID repository.

# SFS-MAKE-MID
This script speeds conversion of an SBC/screen/battery/cellular device into MID.

Device specific configuration such as kernels should still should be checked manually.

This needs the latest versions of KDE 4 specific scripts/config files.

The KDE applications script is the latest one for the project for KDE 4.

The adduser script was needed because I disliked how adduser worked.

Be sure to follow the 10 step process in the MAKE_MID source code.
